<% if @topic.name == "Babysitter Pay Rate" %>
<p>Hey neighbor,</p>
 
<p>When we're shelling out dough for babysitters, I'm always wondering if we're overpaying, scrimping or getting it just right.  Since a call-athon to other parents isn't going to happen, I'm experimenting with a new way to see how our rate stacks up against what other folks like us are paying.</p>

<p>If you're interested too, it's super simple to see how you compare as well &mdash; just <strong>give</strong> your rate below, then <strong>get</strong> back an immediate web comparison against other Alexandrians.<p/>

<p>Hey neighbor,</p>
 
<p>As our kids are already growing up so fast, I'm wondering when the right time is to let my child jump into the mobile world.  Since a call-athon to other parents isn't going to happen, I'm experimenting with a new way to see how the age we plan to give our kids cell phones stacks up against what other folks are doing.</p>

<p>If you're interested too, it's super simple to see how you compare as well &mdash; just <strong>give</strong> the age below, then <strong>get</strong> back an immediate web comparison against other Alexandrians.<p/>

<% elsif @topic.name == "Homework" %>
<p>Hey neighbor,</p>
 
<p>If your house is anything like mine, homework is always a topic of conversation. So I wondered how my child's average homework load compared with other Alexandrians. I've talked to a few neighbors, but I'm also experimenting with a new way to see how our homework load stacks up against what other folks are seeing.</p>

<p>If you're interested too, it's super simple to see how you compare as well &mdash; just <strong>give</strong> the average homework load for one of your kids below, then <strong>get</strong> back an immediate web comparison against other Alexandrians.<p/>
